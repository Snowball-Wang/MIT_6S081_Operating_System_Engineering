sleep.c easy
pingpong.c easy
primes.c difficult, finished with reference to other's solution
find.c moderate, key part is how to do it recursively
xargs.c moderate, key part is how to parse arguments from previous command

I did not record exact time spent on each assignment. Will do it in the next lab.
